A few pointers:
- We mostly keep the output htmls here for hosting, but reproducible notebooks are even better.
- Compress images, to keep repo size small.
- To submit, you can either clone the repo and push (if you have access) or you can make a pull request from a fork.

Some of the notebooks require access to a shared AWS bucket. Ask Dmitry or Dan for the credentials.
